# MarsBar

Little try at making a (locally) functional video-compressor (and / or video-merger) so I don't have to start up HandBrake everytime or go to https://8mb.video/ (which is a great site don't get me wrong).

Currently working on the front-end bit, as this is my first time working with Vue3 (in combination with typescript) this might take me longer than I'd like it to.

This repo may or may not contain all necessary components for this project to fully function, I'll see about it sometime later, as Python might be a requirement, together with some type of local database like PocketBase.
